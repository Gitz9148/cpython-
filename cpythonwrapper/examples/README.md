## üîß Customizing Examples

### Creating Your Own Benchmark

```python
import time
import sys
import os

# Add parent directory to path
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))

import python_implementation
import cpp_accelerated  # If available

def custom_benchmark():
    # Your custom function benchmark
    n = 50000
    
    # Python timing
    start = time.perf_counter()
    py_result = python_implementation.sum_of_squares(n)
    py_time = time.perf_counter() - start
    
    # C++ timing
    start = time.perf_counter()
    cpp_result = cpp_accelerated.sum_of_squares(n)
    cpp_time = time.perf_counter() - start
    
    speedup = py_time / cpp_time
    print(f"Custom benchmark speedup: {speedup:.2f}x")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    custom_benchmark()
```

### Adding New Test Cases

To add your own test cases to the examples:

1. **Basic Usage**: Add to the `basic_examples()` function
2. **Advanced Usage**: Add to any of the specialized functions
3. **Performance Analysis**: Add to the `scenarios` list in `run_comprehensive_analysis()`

## üêõ Troubleshooting Examples

### Common Issues

**Issue**: `ImportError: No module named 'cpp_accelerated'`
**Solution**: Build the C++ extension first:
```bash
cd ..  # Go back to project root
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
cd examples
```

**Issue**: Examples run but show "C++ module not available"
**Solution**: Ensure the C++ extension built successfully and is in the parent directory.

**Issue**: Very slow performance on some examples
**Solution**: The advanced examples use larger datasets. Start with basic examples first.

### Platform-Specific Notes

#### macOS
- Ensure Xcode Command Line Tools are installed
- On Apple Silicon, the extension should build for arm64 automatically

#### Windows
- Visual Studio Build Tools required
- Some examples may show different performance characteristics

#### Linux
- GCC build tools required (`sudo apt install build-essential`)
- Generally shows the best C++ performance improvements

## üìà Understanding the Results

### Performance Metrics Explained

- **Speedup**: How many times faster C++ is compared to Python
- **Improvement %**: Percentage improvement over Python baseline
- **Statistical Analysis**: Mean, median, and standard deviation of multiple runs
- **Results Match**: Verification that both implementations produce identical results

### Interpreting Speedups

- **1x - 5x**: Modest improvement, overhead may be significant
- **5x - 50x**: Good improvement, worthwhile for performance-critical code
- **50x - 500x**: Excellent improvement, highly recommended
- **500x+**: Exceptional improvement, transformative for the application

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with `basic_usage.py` to understand the concepts
2. **Verify Results**: Always check that Python and C++ implementations match
3. **Multiple Runs**: Use multiple iterations for reliable timing measurements
4. **Appropriate Scale**: Use data sizes appropriate for your actual use case
5. **System Warm-up**: Run examples multiple times for consistent results
